# hadb: cheap HA embedded databases

hadb aims to make any embedded database highly available via cloud storage, without having to write custom failover/restore logic. 

hadb's only high-level goal is high availability with better economics with multiple databases - not scaling or performance or single-database optimization.

S3 provides impressive primitives:

- **Strong consistency** (since 2020) -- linearizable reads after writes
- **Conditional PUTs** (ETags) -- compare-and-swap for leader election
- **11 nines durability, 99.99% availability**
- **~$0.02/GB/month**

The hadb pattern is: embed your database in your application, use ecosystem primitives to replicate transactional changes to S3, and let hadb coordinate leader-follower roles and failover using leases in S3.

Read the [project manifesto](PROJECT.md) for the full argument — where hadb shines, why embed your database, tradeoffs, comparisons, and directions.

## Architecture

**Embedded mode** — the database lives inside your application process:

```
┌──────────────┐                        ┌──────────────┐
│   Leader     │                        │  Follower    │
│ ┌──────────┐ │                        │ ┌──────────┐ │
│ │ Your App │ │                        │ │ Your App │ │
│ │    +     │ │    ┌──────────────┐    │ │    +     │ │
│ │   DB     │─┼───>│     S3       │───>┼─│   DB     │ │
│ └──────────┘ │    │              │    │ └──────────┘ │
│ ┌──────────┐ │    │  WAL + lease │    │ ┌──────────┐ │
│ │  hadb    │─┼───>│              │<───┼─│  hadb    │ │
│ └──────────┘ │    └──────────────┘    │ └──────────┘ │
└──────────────┘ <───forward writes──── └──────────────┘
```

**Cluster mode** — hadb runs as a standalone server, applications connect over a wire protocol:

```
┌──────────┐          ┌──────────┐
│ Your App │          │ Your App │
└────┬─────┘          └────┬─────┘
     │ wire protocol       │ wire protocol
     ▼                     ▼
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│   Leader     │    │  Follower    │
│ ┌──────────┐ │    │ ┌──────────┐ │
│ │   DB     │─┼───>│ │   DB     │ │
│ └──────────┘ │ S3 │ └──────────┘ │
│ ┌──────────┐ │    │ ┌──────────┐ │
│ │  hadb    │─┼───>│ │  hadb    │ │
│ └──────────┘ │    │ └──────────┘ │
└──────────────┘<───└──────────────┘
          forward writes
```

Same replication and leader election in both modes. The difference is whether the database shares a process with the application or runs separately.

> If you need cluster mode, consider other traditional HA database setups, as hadb is not clearly better, although it is fun.

## Design

hadb includes three crate layers:

- **hadb** — Core coordination. Leader election, role management, follower behavior, metrics. Generic over four traits. Zero cloud dependencies.
- **hadb-io** — Shared IO infrastructure. S3 client, retry with circuit breaker, concurrent uploads, HMAC-signed webhooks, GFS retention.
- **hadb-lease-s3** — S3 leader election via conditional PUTs (ETags) for compare-and-swap.

Database-specific crates (like haqlite for SQLite) compose all three layers to execute commands, replicate to storage, and determine leadership.

### Example: haqlite (SQLite HA)

```rust
let db = HaQLite::builder("my-s3-bucket")
    .open("my.db", "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (name TEXT)")
    .await?;

db.execute(
    "INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?1)",
    &[SqlValue::Text("Alice".into())]
).await?;

let name: String = db.query_row(
    "SELECT name FROM users WHERE rowid = 1", &[], |row| row.get(0)
).await?;
```

If this node is the leader, writes go directly to the local SQLite database. If it's a follower, writes are forwarded to the leader over HTTP. Reads are local by default — fast, but eventually consistent (followers are 1-2s behind the leader). For strong consistency, reads can forward to the leader too, at the cost of a network round trip.

### Adding a new database

hadb handles coordination; you tell it how your database replicates and executes queries.

| Trait | What it does | SQLite example |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **`Replicator`** | Sync layer — add, pull, remove, sync | [walrust](https://github.com/russellromney/walrust) — WAL replication to S3 |
| **`Executor`** | Query execution — execute, is_mutation | [haqlite](https://github.com/russellromney/haqlite) — rusqlite read/write with role-aware forwarding |
| **`LeaseStore`** | Leader election — read, write_if_match, delete | [hadb-lease-s3](https://github.com/russellromney/hadb/tree/main/hadb-lease-s3) — S3 conditional PUT (ETag CAS) leader claims and node registry |
| **`StorageBackend`** | Coordination blobs — upload, download, list, delete | [hadb-io/s3](https://github.com/russellromney/hadb/tree/main/hadb-io) — S3 for storage |

`LeaseStore` and `StorageBackend` already have S3 implementations in hadb-lease-s3. For most new databases, you only need to implement `Replicator` and `Executor`.

Shared infrastructure (S3 client, retry/circuit breaker, concurrent uploads, webhooks, GFS retention) is provided by [hadb-io](https://github.com/russellromney/hadb/tree/main/hadb-io) — your replicator uses it instead of writing S3 upload logic from scratch.

Built on ideas from [Litestream](https://litestream.io/) and [LiteFS](https://fly.io/blog/introducing-litefs/) by [Ben Johnson](https://github.com/benbjohnson). Litestream proved that S3 replication works for SQLite; LiteFS proved that transparent leader election and read replicas work at the edge. hadb aims to generalize both ideas to any embedded database, as an embedded library.
